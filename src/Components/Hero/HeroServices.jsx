                        The SIPROTEC 6MD85 bay controller is a general-purpose control and
                        automation device with protection function. It has been designed for
                        utilization on all voltage levels, from distribution to
                        transmission. As a part of the SIPROTEC 5 family, it allows the use
                        of a large number of protection functions from the SIPROTEC library.
                        The modular hardware permits application-related IOs to be
                        integrated. Adapt the hardware exactly to your requirements and rely
                        on future-oriented solutions for protection, control, automation,
                        monitoring and PQ basic.it allows the use
